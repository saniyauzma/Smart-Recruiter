            1. **Skills**:
                - List all technical or non-technical skills mentioned in the job description.
                - Include both hard skills (e.g., programming languages, tools, software) and soft skills (e.g., communication, leadership).

            2. **Qualifications**:
                - List the minimum or preferred qualifications (e.g., degrees, certifications, specific industry knowledge).
                - Include any educational background or certifications required for the role.

            3. **Experience**:
                - If explicitly mentioned, provide the required or preferred years of experience (e.g., "3-5 years of experience").
                - If not explicitly mentioned, you can omit this field or set it to `null`.

            4. **Responsibilities**:
                - List the key responsibilities and tasks for the role, as described in the job description.
                - Use bullet points or short phrases to summarize the core duties.

            **Important Instructions**:
            - **Do not hallucinate any information**. Only include details that are explicitly mentioned in the job description. If any category is not mentioned, leave it as `null` or an empty list `[]`.
            - If any information is vague or unclear, provide a reasonable interpretation based on context, but **do not invent details or make assumptions**.
            - Avoid including generalizations or filler content that is not directly related to the job description.

            **Format** the extracted information in a JSON structure like this example:

            ```json
    Example:
    {{
        "skills": ["skill1", "skill2", "skill3"],
