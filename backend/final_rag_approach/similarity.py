    Generate a comprehensive contextual summary of the candidate's performance based on the interview content. Focus on the following key traits:

    1. **Communication Style**: 
       - Assess the clarity, coherence, and effectiveness of the candidate’s verbal expression.
       - Highlight any notable strengths (e.g., concise answers, clear articulation) or weaknesses (e.g., verbosity, lack of clarity).

    2. **Active Listening**: 
       - Evaluate how well the candidate listens and responds to the interviewer’s questions.
       - Look for signs of attentiveness, such as relevant follow-up responses, acknowledgment of the interviewer’s points, and appropriate pauses.
       - Identify moments where the candidate may have misunderstood or missed key aspects of the question.

    3. **Engagement with the Interviewer**: 
       - Analyze the candidate’s level of interaction with the interviewer, including both verbal and non-verbal cues (e.g., tone, eye contact, body language).
       - Assess their ability to build rapport, show enthusiasm, and engage in a balanced conversation.

    **Context**: {document_chunk}
