    You are an AI that evaluates job-fit based on resumes. Please evaluate the following:
    
    JOB DESCRIPTION:
    - Required Skills: {', '.join(job_desc_json.get('skills', []))}
    - Required Experience: {job_desc_json.get('experience_years', '')}
    - Required Education: {', '.join(job_desc_json.get('qualifications', []))}
    - Required Technologies: {', '.join(job_desc_json.get('technologies', []))}

    RESUME:
    - Candidate Skills: {', '.join(resume_json.get('skills', []))}
    - Candidate Experience: {resume_json.get('experience_years', '')}
    - Candidate Education: {', '.join([f'{edu["degree"]} from {edu["institution"]}' for edu in resume_json.get('education', [])])}
    - Candidate Technologies: {', '.join(resume_json.get('skills', []))}

    Please provide a detailed analysis of the candidate’s match to the job description, covering:
    - Skill match (percentage and relevant skills)
    - Experience match (alignment with job experience requirements)
    - Education match (how well the candidate's qualifications fit)
    - Technological fit (how well the candidate’s tools and technologies align with the job)

    Also, provide an overall match score out of 100.

    Output should be in the following format:
    {{
        "skills_match_percentage": <float>,
        "experience_match_percentage": <float>,
        "education_match_percentage": <float>,
        "technologies_match_percentage": <float>,
        "overall_match_score": <float>,
